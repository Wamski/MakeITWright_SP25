# Security (Or severe lack of)

## The good
- For our flashcards app, we implemented a login screen for users to register/login into. The goal was to have usernames/passwords to be written to a file, with the intention of obfuscating it to the cloud if we had time. 
- To ensure our user's passwords were good, we provided feedback on their password length.  
- We also put in a small robot checker captcha. 

## The bad 
- Due to time constants, Usernames/passwords were not saved and users could not safely access their account. 
- The robot checker may not be up to security standards. 

## The future
- We hope to fix these issues in the future by making a better, safer, and easier for our users.
